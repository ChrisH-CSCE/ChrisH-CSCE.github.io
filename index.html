    <div class="about">
        <h2>My name is Christopher Hunt. I am 18 and im a Computer engineering major.</h2>
        <p>On the work side of my life I am passionate about working on computers and all the gadgets
inside of them but on the other side I am passionate about my family and relationships I have.
Some efforts I enjoy are getting things right and working through things with friends. I think the
words that best describe me are cheerful when Iâ€™m around people I care about and optimistic
because I believe I can get through stuff even if it is challenging. I want others to describe me as
being a kind person and always being there when I am needed</p>
